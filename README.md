## Table of Contents

#### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines (basic)](p1-basic-lane-detection)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, OpenCV

#### [P2 - Detecting Lane Lines (advanced)](p2-advanced-lane-detection)
 - **Summary:** Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, OpenCV
